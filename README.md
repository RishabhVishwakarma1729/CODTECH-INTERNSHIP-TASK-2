# California Housing Price Prediction

## Overview

This project demonstrates a linear regression model applied to the California Housing dataset, collected during the 1990 California census. The goal is to predict housing prices in California based on various features.

## Features

The dataset includes the following features:
- **MedInc**: Median income in block group
- **HouseAge**: Median house age in block group
- **AveRooms**: Average number of rooms per household
- **AveBedrms**: Average number of bedrooms per household
- **Population**: Block group population
- **AveOccup**: Average number of household members
- **Latitude**: Block group latitude
- **Longitude**: Block group longitude

## Project Steps

1. **Importing Necessary Libraries**: We begin by importing the required Python libraries.
2. **Loading the Dataset**: The dataset is loaded and examined.
3. **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, feature scaling, and other preprocessing steps.
4. **Splitting the Dataset**: The dataset is split into training and testing sets.
5. **Training the Model**: A linear regression model is trained using the training data.
6. **Making Predictions**: Predictions are made on the testing set.
7. **Evaluating the Model**: Model performance is evaluated using mean squared error (MSE) and R² score.


## Results

The model's performance is evaluated using mean squared error (MSE) and the R² score, providing insight into its accuracy and predictive power.
