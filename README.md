California Housing Price Prediction

This project demonstrates a linear regression model applied to the California Housing dataset. The notebook includes steps for importing necessary libraries, loading the dataset, splitting it into training and testing sets, training the linear regression model, making predictions, and evaluating the model's performance using mean squared error and RÂ² score.

The goal of this project is to predict housing prices in California based on various features such as median income, housing median age, total rooms, total bedrooms, population, households, latitude, and longitude. We use a linear regression model to achieve this.

The dataset used in this project is the California Housing dataset, which contains information collected during the 1990 California census.

 The dataset includes the following features:
 
MedInc: Median income in block group
HouseAge: Median house age in block group
AveRooms: Average number of rooms per household
AveBedrms: Average number of bedrooms per household
Population: Block group population
AveOccup: Average number of household members
Latitude: Block group latitude
Longitude: Block group longitude
